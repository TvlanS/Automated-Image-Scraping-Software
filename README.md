### 1) Automated Image Scraping Software

**Objective:** Develop a one-click system to scrape image, resize it, and copy it to the clipboard based on the query.

**Description:** 

My endeavor to learn a new language has led to the realization that learning new words is more effective when they are associated with a relevant image. However, I quickly realized that multitasking between searching for an image on the browser and learning the word simultaneously is inefficient in terms of cognitive economy. On top of that, the copied image needs to be resized manually to a consistent size, which can become tedious. As a result, I conceptualized a one-click solution that would automate the process of selecting, copying, and resizing the image, allowing me to focus more on learning.

**Key features include:**
1.	An intuitive UI.
2.	A small window that allows for a seamless transition to other software.
3.	Automatic image resizing.
4.	Sticks to the display, eliminating the need to toggle the software back to the window while multitasking.
5.	Automatically positions itself in the corner of the screen, avoiding visual clutter.
